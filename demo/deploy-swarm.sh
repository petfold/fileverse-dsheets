# Deploy the demo app itself to Ethereum Swarm as a static website.
#
# Builds the demo with relative asset paths and the Bee API baked in, then
# uploads the bundle as a Swarm collection (manifest with an index
# document). The printed /bzz URL serves the app straight from the network —
# app code, images, documents and version history all live on Swarm.
#
# The upload is *synchronous* (`swarm-deferred-upload: false`): the call
# only returns once the chunks have been pushed out to the network. Bee's
# default is deferred, which stores locally and syncs in the background —
# fine for private data, wrong for a site meant to be opened by others,
# because stopping the node before that finishes leaves the content
# unretrievable everywhere else. It makes the upload slower and it is worth
# it: a visitor's node hangs indefinitely looking for chunks nobody serves.
#
# Usage:  BEE_API_URL=http://localhost:1633 ./deploy-swarm.sh
#         SWARM_POSTAGE_BATCH_ID=<id>  pins a batch (else auto-discovered).
#         SWARM_DEFERRED=true          opt back into background syncing.
#         VITE_CONFIG=<file>           override the vite config.
